For the network analysis we will begin by looking at the large network, as previously shown in [Data](../data-description), the network seems to have some clustering that is seperated by the different animal classes.

As also seen, some animal classes have more subclusters, the primary 4 and their location in respect to the center <font color=#a328cc>Reptilia</font> (South-east),  <font color=#cc7228>Arachnida</font> (East), <font color=#cc4428>Amphibia</font> (North) and <font color=#2882cc>Mammalia</font> (South-west). 
And we see other classes such as <font color=#cc9728>Aves</font> (South), <font color=#cc3228>Actinopterygii</font> (West) and <font color=#289dcc>Insecta</font> (North-East), where its nodes are still in one big clusters and that are no or minor subclusters.

In order to see if these connection can be caused by pure chance, we will start by looking at the fraction of edges that are in the same class, and compare it to one where the edges are randomly shuffled. For our network we see that the average fraction of edges that belong in the same class is 0.685 and for the randomly shuffled network it is 0.158. This strongly indicates that this cannot be explained by pure chance. This also makes sense when we think about what the underlying data actually is, the wikipedia pages for the majority of the animals in this dataset are not that long. Resulting in the page only containing information that is strictly about this animal and only a few references to articles that relate to the species. We do not observe an Arachnida linking to an Actinopterygii, as these two animal classes live in totally different eco systems.

If we then look at the assortativity coefficient, which is a measurement for how likely similar nodes are to connect to other similar nodes over dissimilar nodes. When looking at the attribute Class we observe the coefficient to be 0.777, which indicates a strong connection that nodes in similar classes connect to each other and not from different classes. If we instead compare this for when we look at the attribute Family we see a coefficient of 0.352. Indicating that it is more likely for a node to connect to dissimilar nodes (when comparing to 0.777), the network with color coding by family can be seen below:

When comparing the two networks visually, we also observe this result. For color coding by class we see that nodes of similar classes (colors) are more likely to be connected to each other than to ones of different classes (different colors). Whereas for color coding by family, we see that the nodes of the same family are more likely to connect to other families.
