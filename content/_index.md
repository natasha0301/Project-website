The central idea of the project is to use Wikipedia API to create an animal dataset. What we want to do then is to see how many links there are to other related animal species and how many times the other species is mentioned will add to the weight. So we would use these links to create edges between nodes (animals). So an example is an article about an elephant on Wikipedia, a rhino is mentioned, which will create an edge to a rhino node and a link to a rhino is mentioned twice it will give the edge weight. This will be repeated for multiple animals pages on Wikipedia to investigate how they are linked.
